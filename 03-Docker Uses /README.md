## **🐳 Benefits of Docker**

1. **Runs Anywhere** – Same image runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, cloud, server.
2. **No "It works on my machine" problem** – Same environment for all developers.
3. **Fast Deployment** – Start containers in seconds.
4. **Easy Setup** – Just `docker run` instead of installing multiple dependencies.
5. **Isolation** – Each container runs in its own space, no conflicts.
6. **Scalable** – Can run multiple containers easily (horizontal scaling).
7. **Version Control for Environment** – Rollback to previous image version.
8. **Lightweight** – Uses fewer resources than virtual machines.

## **🚫 If We Don’t Use Docker**

1. **Manual Setup** – Need to install Java, DB, dependencies manually on every machine.
2. **OS Compatibility Issues** – Works on one computer but fails on another.
3. **More Bugs in Deployment** – Different environments cause unexpected errors.
4. **Slow Onboarding** – New developer takes hours/days to set up project.
5. **Hard to Scale** – Running multiple copies requires complex setup.
6. **Version Mismatch** – Library or DB versions differ between dev, test, prod.

---

💡 **In short:**

* **With Docker** → You package your app + environment → Runs everywhere the same.
* **Without Docker** → More setup, more errors, more time wasted.

## **📄 What is a Dockerfile?**

* A **Dockerfile** is just a **text file** that contains instructions for **building a Docker image**.
* Think of it as a **recipe** — step-by-step instructions to prepare your app’s environment.
* When you run `docker build`, Docker reads the Dockerfile and creates an **image**.

---

## **🔹 Why use a Dockerfile?**

1. You can **automate environment setup** (no manual installation).
2. **Same environment everywhere** (dev, test, prod).
3. Easy to **update** — just change the file and rebuild the image.

## **🛠 Common Dockerfile Instructions**

| Command   | What it Does                                             | Example                                         |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `FROM`    | Base image to start from.                                | `FROM openjdk:17`                               |
| `WORKDIR` | Set working directory inside container.                  | `WORKDIR /app`                                  |
| `COPY`    | Copy files from your computer to container.              | `COPY target/myapp.jar /app/myapp.jar`          |
| `RUN`     | Run a command inside the image (install packages, etc.). | `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl` |
| `CMD`     | Default command to run when container starts.            | `CMD ["java", "-jar", "myapp.jar"]`             |
| `EXPOSE`  | Inform which port the container will listen on.          | `EXPOSE 8080`                                   |

## **📌 Example: Java Spring Boot App**

**Dockerfile**

```dockerfile
# Step 1: Use base image with Java
FROM openjdk:17

# Step 2: Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Step 3: Copy JAR file into container
COPY target/myapp.jar /app/myapp.jar

# Step 4: Expose port 8080
EXPOSE 8080

# Step 5: Run the app
CMD ["java", "-jar", "myapp.jar"]
```

---

## **🚀 How to Use**

1. Build image

   ```bash
   docker build -t myapp .
   ```
2. Run container

   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 myapp
   ```

---

## **💡 Without Dockerfile**

* You’d have to **manually install Java**, copy your app, run it, and hope all configs match.
* With Dockerfile, **just one command** (`docker build`) sets everything up perfectly.
